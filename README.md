to run the app in task 5:

1- open the terminal in the directory of the backend and run "npm install" then run "node index.js".

the backend was created using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB was used for the database.

please note that you need to have MongoDB installed on your machine for the backend to run properly as the database is created locally on MongoDB.

2- open the terminal in the directory of the frontend and run "npm install" then run "npm run dev" or "npm start"

the frontend was created using ReactJS, tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI.

3- to use and test the app, open your browser and go to "http://localhost:5173/".

4- you can go to "http://localhost:5173/home" to skip the login/signup and jump to the design.

for task 6, each question has a corresponding folder containing the javascript file for the required function.
